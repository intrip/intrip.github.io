Hello guys, it's been years that i'm using bash as my preferred shell. Recently i've found a cool tool that you should try, it's called: [oh my zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/). What's that? It's zsh: basically bash with some more features and also have cool plugins made by develpers that you can enable to have easier time progamming in your preferred language. 
<!-- more -->
There are more then 150 plugins and you should definatelly take a look at that!
the install is also really easy, for example here's the command to run on MacOSX 'curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh' and you're done!

Take a look and enjoy this cool tool!
