<h4>
I'm a software engineer: my current job is leading  <a href="https://www.iubenda.com/en/" target="blank">iubenda</a> backend development team.
I'm also an avid OSS contributor and a member of the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/" target="_blank">Gitlab Core Team</a>, check my <a href="#oss-contributions">OSS contributions</a>.

My knowledge is mainly focused in the web context. I embrace the philosophy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel" target="blank">don't reinvent the wheel</a>,
like open source software and love to share my thoughts with the community.

Lately I've been working mostly with <b>Ruby</b> and <b>Ruby on Rails</b>.

I think automation is key: I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="blank">TDD development</a> as a tool to
create stable and reusable code, but always write automated tests for the whole stack of the
application following the [test pyramid principle](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html){:target="_blank"}.

### OSS contributions

Below you can find the list of my OSS contributions (some of them are trivial whilst some are more
important):
