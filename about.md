<h4>
I'm a software engineer: my current job is leading  <a href="https://www.iubenda.com/en/" target="blank">iubenda</a> backend development team.
I'm also an avid OSS contributor and member of the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/" target="_blank">Gitlab Core Team</a>.

## Principles

Below you'll find the key engineering principles in which I believe:

- **Not over engineering**: Always try to "do the simple thing", embrace the philosophy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel" target="blank">don't reinvent the wheel</a> but *when is required* also do the groundwork.
- **Self management**: Don't need a manager which does daily check-ins.
- **Automation is key**: when something has to be done always consider the trade-off of automating the
    process.
  - One big part of automation is testing: use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="blank">TDD development</a> when is fit
    and test the full stack of the application following the [test pyramid principle](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html){:target="_blank"}.
- **Write code for humans**: write code to be read by humans, debugged by humans and maintained by humans.

## Motivations

Over the years I've figured out what motivates me and the conditions under which I like to work:

- **Culture**: I enjoy working on open and diversified environment using cross-functional teams, micro-management is not acceptable.
- **Role**: I'm mostly knowledged in back-end development using <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, can work on the frontend too but it's not my strongest skill. I do embrace the DevOps movement and have hands on infrastucture management with Kubernetes.
- **Transparency**: I work more effectively when the company shares as much of the long-term intentions as possible.
- **Work-life balance**: While I am ok with putting in a few extra hours on rare occasions, regular over-time is not something I do.
