<h4>
Hi everybody. I'm a software engineer living in Brescia (Italy) and a member of the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/" target="_blank">Gitlab Core Team</a>.

My knowledge is mainly focused in web context.
I embrace the philosophy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel" target="blank">don't reinvent the wheel</a>
like open source software and love to share my thoughts with the community.
Lately I've been working a lot with <b>Ruby on rails</b>. I use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="blank">TDD development</a> as a tool to
create stable and reusable code, but never forget to test my code in acceptance(mostly with capybara).
Beside I prefer server-side programming I'm trying to keep my knowledge
balanced between back-end and front-end.
If you wanna see my open source projects you can check my <a href="https://github.com/intrip" target="blank">github profile page</a>
I've got a master degree in "IT Engineering" at the university of Brescia in 2012
